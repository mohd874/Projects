<H1>Forwarding demo. </H1>
<BR>
In case you have javascript enabled and were not backtracking, you will be 
forwarded to <A HREF="base.html">http://www.sccoutway/web/forwarding/base.html</A>. 
(That happens to be from where you probably came from). 
<P> If you came here by backtracking however, no forwarding happens. You could 
  simply continue with back tracking. 
<P><i>View the source of this page to see how it works. &nbsp;Please give 
  me credit when you use my little hack. </i><i>If forwarding should fail, 
  <a href="base.html">that</a> is probably where you came from. Sorry but 
  this mechanism does not work with all browsers. </i>
